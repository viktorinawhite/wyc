## About the Project

This digital exhibit was designed to satisfy Viktorina White's Master of Library and Information Science capstone requirement. 
The project sponsor is John Bolcer, Walter L. and Rosemary S. Berg Endowed University Archivist, from the Unviversity of Washington Special Collections. 

## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The images are from the University of Washington Special Collections' [University of Washington Yacht Club records](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv784378).
