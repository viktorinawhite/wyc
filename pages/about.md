## About the Collection

This site features a collection of digitized slides from the [University of Washington Yacht Club records](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv784378), housed in the University of Washington Special Collections. Established in 1948, this student-run sailing club fosters a unique tradition of on-campus sailing at the University of Washington Waterfront Activities Center (WAC) and in surrounding waters. This digital exhibit primarily features images captured between 1960 and 1987. Many of the activities depicted—such as social sailing in Union Bay, decorating boats for Opening Day, and the Snooze and Cruise to Blake Island— are still carried on today.  

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images

The images were generated from Slide Box 1 and Slide Box 2 in the University of Washington Special Collections' [University of Washington Yacht Club records](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv784378).

## About the Project

This digital exhibit was created to satisfy Viktorina White's capstone requirement for her Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program at the University of Washington (UW). As a member of the University of Washington Yacht Club, she learned of upcoming renovations to the University's Waterfront Activities Center (WAC) and Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW) Shell House that threatens accessible, on-campus sailing. She was motivated to create this digital exhibit to highlight the legacy of this student-run club at the WAC. She also has a BA in Political Science from New York University and a M.Phil. in Public History and Cultural Heritage from Trinity College Dublin. 

Much gratitude goes to John Bolcer, the Walter L. and Rosemary S. Berg Endowed University Archivist at the UW Special Collections, for sponsoring this project. Thank you to Ruba Sadi, Public Services Coordinator at the UW Special Collections, for facilitating digitization of the slides and creation of JPGs. Thanks to Ari Emerson for scanning the slides, and June Cliff and Karalee Harris for assigning negative numbers. Additional thanks to Tracy Nishimoto, Accessioning Archivist at the UW Special Collections, for facilitating my access to the collection and processing guidance.
